  After the form is submitted, the new Contact will be saved and then sent to a page at the URL /contact/new. This page says "You created a contact!" and it shows the full Contact info. it has a link back to the homepage and the new one they just made should be there as well.

  The homepage also contains a clear button at the bottom of the list that clears all of the contacts and taken to a confirmation page at /contacts/clear that says "Address book cleared!". There is also a link back to the home page at the root path.
