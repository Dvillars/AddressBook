#### _**By: Derek Villars**_

### _Link to Site: (using github pages)_
if you wish to view this site [->Click Here<-](https://DVillars.github.io/pizza) it should open right away.

### _Setup/Installation Requirements:_
 After Cloning this repository to your computer you need to open the index.html file and the website should open up in your browser.

### _Specifications:_
  Create a Contact class. This class should include properties for the person's name, phone number and address.

  The homepage of the app at the root path (localhost:5004) should list all Contacts, and allow users to click a Contact's name to go to a separate page to view its details.
  
  The homepage should also contain a link to a page presenting the user with a form they can fill out to create a new Contact. After the form is submitted, the new Contact object should be saved into a static List and the user should be taken to a different page at the URL /contact/new. This page should tell them "You created a contact!" and display the name, phone number, and address of that new contact. It should also have a link back to the homepage with the list of all saved contacts, including the new one they just made.

  The homepage should also contain a form with only a clear button at the bottom of the list of all contacts. When this is pressed, all Contacts should be deleted, and the user should be taken to a confirmation page at /contacts/clear. On this page they should be shown a confirmation message saying "Address book cleared!". There should also be a link back to the home page at the root path.
